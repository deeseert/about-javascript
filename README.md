## What is this?

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook that details some of the practices I adopt in my JS code. It's an highly opinionated commentary and everything it contains is explained with an agenda in mind. E.g. When talking about Dependency Injection I'm not going to expose all the possible use cases for it - I'm just going to show you why and how **I** make use of it in my overall coding style.


## Installation

Make sure you have Jupyter installed along with the Javascript/Node.js kernel.

Clone the repo and run

    npm install

Then you can just open the notebook in Jupyter.
